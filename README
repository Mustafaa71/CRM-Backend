CRM Backend Project

Overview

This project involves building the backend (i.e., server-side portion) of a CRM application using Go. Users can make HTTP requests to your server to perform CRUD operations. This project is designed to solidify your skills in building an HTTP server, designing RESTful endpoints, and handling business logic for API requests.
